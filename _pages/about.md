I'm Wuwen Wang, an incoming CS Ph.D. student at XXX University. I received my master's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from UIUC.

My research primarily focuses on large-scale high-performance data systems. I’m currently working on the query execution in databases. 

I’m fortunate enough to be a member of [Carnegie Mellon Database Group](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/) and work with [Prof. Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). During my time at CMU DB, I have been a developer for [NoisePage](https://noise.page/), the self-driving in-memory database we developed at CMU. 

If you’re a CMU student interested in database research, talk to Andy when he is back! He is one of the best professors and brilliant people I’ve met. He is in love with DB (Which appears to be the second most important thing in his life : ). He also treats students as friends and always tries his best to help them, either in research or life. He has introduced the beauty of databases to me and, more importantly, made me a better person.

I’m going to work as an intern for the [Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) and begin my Ph.D. study in the fall.

Don’t hesitate to contact me if you would like to collaborate or need any information.
